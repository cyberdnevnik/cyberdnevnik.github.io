## Hi there!
<br>
Starting this blog was equally exciting and terrifying. (Similar to finding a job in cybersecurity nowadays.) Being still fresh in the cybersecurity field you’re questioning whether you’re even qualified to write anything about it, but if we are thinking about it, learning it and struggling with it, then most likely other cybersecurity newbies are doing the same. And why not share our own difficulties and challenges with the world? 
<br>
<br>
We are three cybersecurity enthusiasts who enjoy sharing insights, discoveries and thoughts on topics we work on and the ones that spark our interest. This blog is built on genuine interest, continuous learning and a commitment to quality content. From technical **Articles** and reflections on industry trends to personal struggles and ideas in the **Journals** we want to make cybersecurity more accessible and engaging - whether you’re an expert, student or starting to explore it.
<br>
<br>
Being aware of the extent of the field, its domains, paths, certifications but mostly its dynamic nature we found ourselves wanting to share our own experiences in the field of cybersecurity. We are not experts but you need to start from somewhere.
<br>
<br>
Thanks and see you for the next one!
