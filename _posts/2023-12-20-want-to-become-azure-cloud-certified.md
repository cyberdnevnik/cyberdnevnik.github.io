In my previous article I wrote about the cybersecurity skill gap and how to fix it. As promised, this article will be more focused on cloud and how to become cloud certified, specifically Azure cloud certified.

Per Gartner biggest public cloud providers in 2023 are:

* **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** has a market share of 40%
* **Microsoft Azure** has a market share of 21.5%
* **Alibaba Group** has a market share of 7.7%
* **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** with Market Share of 7.5%

For this article, I will stick to the Azure certifications, while other big cloud providers will be covered in future articles.

## Microsoft Azure

As seen in the picture above, there are a lot of paths regarding the Azure cloud. The main paths would be:
 
* **Security**
 
* **Data and Analytics**

* **Developer**

* **Infrastructure**

* **AI**

## Fundamentals-level Exams

If you are starting to learn Azure Cloud, there is one main starting point for all the other paths — AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals.

I am putting the Azure Fundamentals exam before the other fundamentals exam because it gives you a **higher-level overview** of the whole Azure Cloud, services, differences between **IaaS** (Infrastructure as a Service), **SaaS** (Software as a Service), and **PaaS** (Platform as a Service), and all the shared responsibility on the cloud between Microsoft and customers.

It is not only a fundamentals exam since all of those previously mentioned paths have their own fundamentals exam:
* Security — [SC-900: Microsoft Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/security-compliance-and-identity-fundamentals/)


* Data & Analytics — [DP-900: Microsoft Azure Data Fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-data-fundamentals/?practice-assessment-type=certification)

* AI — [AI-900: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals/?practice-assessment-type=certification)

![Microsoft Certified Fundamentals badge — image courtesy of Microsoft Learn](/assets/img/posts/img_want_to_become_cloud_certified/fundamentals.png)

As you could see on the roadmap above, the **developer** and **infrastructure** paths don’t have their own Fundamentals exam, so **AZ-900** is the recommended one before you move into associate and expert-level exams on those paths.

**But before proceeding on the other paths, I would strongly recommend taking AZ-900 to get a good overview of the Azure cloud as a whole.**

## Associate-level Exams

If you are reading this part, then good for you! That suggests that you’ve passed one of the fundamental exams and you want to see where to go next.

![Microsoft Certified Associate badge — image courtesy of Microsoft Learn](/assets/img/posts/img_want_to_become_cloud_certified/associate.png)

### Oh, so those are all official certificates. But is there any other way I can prove my skills without taking the official certificates?

Well, yes, of course there is. Microsoft thought of that part as well. Since last month, Microsoft has introduced [Applied Skills](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-learn-blog/announcing-microsoft-applied-skills-the-new-credentials-to/ba-p/3775645), a new way to demonstrate your Azure knowledge through different types of labs.

They give you 2 hours to finish the lab with some tasks and demonstrate your skills in a test environment. Even if you fail for some reason, don’t fret — **you can retake the lab every 72 hours**, so that should take some pressure off your shoulders.

### Ok, Vedran, got it. Long way ahead, but tell me what path you took.

Well, for me, it was quite easy since I wanted to get mostly into the security part. So initially, I figured out I needed more general Azure knowledge, which led me to take the **AZ-900 exam**.

After I got that one in the bag, my next step was to do the **AZ-500**, which I’d also passed 1.5 years after I got the job in the first place.

Now my last piece of the puzzle in the security path is **SC-100**, which I plan to take in the near future, and after that, who knows? I will need to look at this article and think about it for a while. It will also depend on the requirements of my team and projects in general.

From the **Applied skills** side, I’ve completed — [Configure SIEM security operations using Microsoft Sentinel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/applied-skills/configure-siem-security-operations-using-microsoft-sentinel/) and [Secure Azure services and workloads with Microsoft Defender for Cloud regulatory compliance controls](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/applied-skills/secure-azure-services-and-workloads-with-microsoft-defender-for-cloud-regulatory-compliance-controls/) at the moment, but I plan to take a few more in the future.

Anyway, once I’ve decided on both certificates and applied skills, I will keep you all in the loop.
