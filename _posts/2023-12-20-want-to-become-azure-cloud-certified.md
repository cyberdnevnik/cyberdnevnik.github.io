In my previous article I wrote about the cybersecurity skill gap and how to fix it. As promised, this article will be more focused on cloud and how to become cloud certified, specifically Azure cloud certified.

Per Gartner biggest public cloud providers in 2023 are:

* Amazon AWS has a market share of 40%
* Microsoft Azure has a market share of 21.5%
* Alibaba Group has a market share of 7.7%
* Google Cloud Platform with Market Share of 7.5%

For this article, I will stick to the Azure certifications, while other big cloud providers will be covered in future articles.

## Microsoft Azure

As seen in the picture above, there are a lot of paths regarding the Azure cloud. The main paths would be:
 
* **Security**
 
* **Data and Analytics**

* **Developer**

* **Infrastructure**

* **AI**

## Fundamentals-level Exams

If you are starting to learn Azure Cloud, there is one main starting point for all the other paths — AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals.

I am putting the Azure Fundamentals exam before the other fundamentals exam because it gives you a **higher-level overview** of the whole Azure Cloud, services, differences between **IaaS** (Infrastructure as a Service), **SaaS** (Software as a Service), and **PaaS** (Platform as a Service), and all the shared responsibility on the cloud between Microsoft and customers.

It is not only a fundamentals exam since all of those previously mentioned paths have their own fundamentals exam:
* Security — [SC-900: Microsoft Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/security-compliance-and-identity-fundamentals/)


* Data & Analytics — [DP-900: Microsoft Azure Data Fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-data-fundamentals/?practice-assessment-type=certification)

* AI — [AI-900: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals/?practice-assessment-type=certification)

As you could see on the roadmap above, the **developer** and **infrastructure** paths don’t have their own Fundamentals exam, so **AZ-900** is the recommended one before you move into associate and expert-level exams on those paths.

**But before proceeding on the other paths, I would strongly recommend taking AZ-900 to get a good overview of the Azure cloud as a whole.**

## Associate-level Exams

If you are reading this part, then good for you! That suggests that you’ve passed one of the fundamental exams and you want to see where to go next.

Well, for starters, there are far more associate-level exams than fundamentals. The latest list is:

### Developer Certifications

* [AZ-204: Azure Developer Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-developer/) - participates in all phases of development, including requirements gathering, design, development, deployment, security, maintenance, performance tuning, and monitoring. 
Also, it is **recommended** for you have at least **two years** of professional development experience and experience with Azure

### Data and Analytics Engineer Certifications




## Conclusion

To find your place in this continuously growing space of Cybersecurity I would like to leave you with a few questions.

    1. What team sounds most interesting to you?

    2. How much time are you willing to invest to become great at that topic?

    3. How much does it resonate with your sense of purpose and responsibility?

I hope these questions help you in your quest to find your own path and also help us fill that gap, which also made me write this article.

Going further, I will be mostly focused on writing articles related to Cloud Security, **Hrvoje(Herc)** will be writing on Penetration testing while Endpoint-related and much more will be in articles written by **Martina**

Thank you for sticking with me until the end. I hope you found it useful.

For all the questions and all the feedback on the subject, you can find me on my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/vedran-brodar).

Cheers,  
Vedran
