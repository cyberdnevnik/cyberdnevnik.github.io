A few days ago, while scouring the never-ending vastness of the documentation, looking for some architectural references (outside of MCRA), I came to a page that blew my mind - Microsoft Learn Security Hub.

## Library of Alexandria

Of course, it's an overstatement, it felt like it - but why? Well, just click the link below:

[Microsoft Security Hub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/)

Because everything was available from **one page**, all the documentation related to the Security services was there.

If you are a beginner and you want to **kickstart** your Cybersecurity Journey with achievable milestones  -  [Security 101: Cybersecurity for Beginners](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/plans/odm7f0p5j6opq5?wt.mc_id=securityhub_security101_webpage_cnl#)

If you don't want to read, but you would like to participate in more **instructor-led hands-on sessions**, fret not - [Microsoft Virtual Training days](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/events/category/microsoft-virtual-training-days?filters=delivery-language%3Aenglish&scenario=mvtd) got you covered

With Virtual training days Microsoft Certified instructor delivers the training with **presentations, demo's and Q&A**. Depending on the training, some include **hands-on labs** for practical experience.

## Azure Security Product Docs

Also, all the services I work with day to day can be accessed from that portal:

* [Microsoft Sentinel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/)

* [Microsoft Defender](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender/)

* [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/)

* [Microsoft Purview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/)

* [Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/)

* [Microsoft Intune](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/)

* [Copilot for Security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/security/)

From their pages, you can deep dive into  how each of the services can be **deployed and maintained** alongside Microsoft-provided **best practices** for each of them.

## Credentials for Security

Collection created specifically for getting your skills up and running as fast as possible. There are **certification paths** with documentation and learning paths, and if you want a more hands-on approach,  **Applied Skills** will give you more hands-on-lab-like experience.

## Zero trust, architecture, processes and technology

* [Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference Architectures (MCRA)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/adoption/mcra) - which is a great reference point for enabling end-to-end security using Zero Trust principles.

* [Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/secure/overview) - provides a structured approach and guidance that applies across every methodology of CAF.

![Cloud Adoption Framework methodology steps - image courtesy of Microsoft](/assets/img/posts/img_microsoft_security_hub/caf.png)

* [Well-Architected Framework (WAF)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/security/) - provides a set of architectural decision points to help solution architects build a technical foundation for their workloads.

* [Microsoft Cybersecurity Architect Learner Journey](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/assessments/91e16bc4-490a-4eaa-8af9-3e7510a6b146/) - a great way of assessing the readiness of your environment with pragmatic recommendations based on specific needs (there is a score tracker, which is always nifty and useful)

## Conclusion

In case everything I've mentioned above isn't enough, there are engagements with communities, CISO workshops, the security tech community, the Security Blog, and the Security YouTube channel.

This gives you freedom to explore all of Microsoft security in a way that works best for you.
